Now we're ready to create some more complex smart functions. 
Lets have a little bit of a look around JsTz and see what's around. 
We've tried to make things as familiar as possible so if you're a javascript or typescript developer you should feel right at home. If you're new to javascript, or just need a refresher we'd advise you to dig into the tutorials here first. 

If you've done some typescript before we'd advise you to skip straight to the last tutorial where we put everything together and create a small smart_function. Or just skip straight to the next chapter where we'll look at the JsTz API and the blockchain specific parts. After all, that's why you're here isn't it?
