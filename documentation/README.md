# Welcome to the JsTz Dcoumentation

JsTz Documentation is currently under construction, in the meantime feel free to read the code.

## Contributing and complaining
The JsTz codebase is still in its infancy so we're not welcoming direct contributions just yet, but we'd love to hear your feedback.  

### Feedback
We're not building this for us, we're building it for you. Whether you're a seasoned blockchain engineer or a starry eyed Web developer hoping to take your first tentative steps into the world we're calling web3, we'd love to hear about your experiences.

If you'd like to leave feedback just create a branch `feedback@<whatever you're complaining about>` add your comments to the documentation and open a pull request.


### Documentation changes
If you'd like to help with the documentation that's great. 
You can start with this bit.
