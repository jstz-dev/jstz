# 👨‍⚖️ Jstz

Jstz (pronounced "justice") is a JavaScript server runtime for Tezos [Smart Rollups](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/smart-rollups) with a great developer experience.
With Jstz, you can deploy JavaScript applications known as _smart functions_ that can act as the backend for web applications, including handling logic, storing data, and accepting and distributing payments.

In particular, Jstz is:

- 🚀 **Fast**: Jstz is built on [Boa](https://boajs.dev/), a blazingly fast JavaScript engine written in Rust.
- 📚 **Easy to learn**: Jstz is built with the developer in mind.
- ⚡️ **Fully local**: You can test and develop smart functions locally with a sandbox.

The Jstz command-line toolkit, sandbox, SDK, and other tools in this repository are free and open source software under the [MIT license](https://github.com/jstz-dev/jstz/blob/main/LICENSE).

Jstz smart functions look like ordinary JavaScript functions, but they have some differences and limitations; see [Smart functions](/functions/overview).

To get started, try the [Quick start](/quick_start).
