# üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è `JsTz`

`JsTz` is a JavaScript server runtime for Tezos 2.0
with a great developer experience. It is built on [boa](https://boajs.dev/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

`JsTz` is free and open source software under the [MIT license](TODO).


JsTz Documentation is currently under construction, in the meantime feel free to read the code.

## Contributing and complaining
The JsTz codebase is still in its infancy so we're not welcoming direct contributions just yet, but we'd love to hear your feedback.

### Feedback
We're not building this for us, we're building it for you. Whether you're a seasoned blockchain engineer or a starry eyed Web developer hoping to take your first tentative steps into the world we're calling web3, we'd love to hear about your experiences.

If you'd like to leave feedback...
