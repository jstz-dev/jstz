  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |     |
  |     borrowed value does not live long enough
  |     binding `compartment_id` declared here
6 |     assert_eq!(a, b);
7 | }
  | -
  | |
  | `compartment_id` dropped here while still borrowed
  | borrow might be used here, when `compartment_region` is dropped and runs the `Drop` code for type `Region`
  |
  = note: values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are defined
  = note: this error originates in the macro `alloc_compartment` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
