//! This module provides the mechanisms to manage roots in SpiderMonkey's garbage collection (GC) system.
//! Rooting ensures that specific objects are kept alive during GC cycles by marking them as reachable.
//! It is a critical component of GC, preventing unintended collection of active or important objects.
//!
//! In languages with native support for GC (such as JavaScript), rooting is supported by the compiler/interpreter,
//! which can provide metadata for each stack frame allowing it to be traced. However, as implementators of native
//! objects/functions for JavaScript, we have no such metadata. Instead rooting has to be performed explicitly.
//!
//! This explicit rooting is needed whenever an object is needed to outlive the borrow of the JS
//! context that produced it. For example, a function that compiles and then evaluates a script:
//! ```no_run rust
//! pub fn compile_and_evaluate<S>(
//!     path: &Path,
//!     src: &str,
//!     mut cx: &mut Context<S>,
//! ) -> Option<JsValue<'_, C>> where S: InCompartment<C> + CanAlloc {
//!     let script = Script::compile(path, src, &mut cx)?;
//!
//!     script.evaluate(&mut cx)
//! }
//! ```
//! This is the natural way to write such a function, however, it is in fact not safe since the script
//! is not rooted. If `evaluate` triggers a GC before the script is rooted during evaluation, then `script`
//! may be reclaimed, causing a later use-after-free error.
//!
//! Fortunately, our approach catches these safety problems as lifetime errors:
//! ```notrust
//! error[E0499]: cannot borrow `cx` as mutable more than once at a time
//!    --> crates/jstz_engine/src/script.rs:111:25
//!     |
//! 109 |         let script = Script::compile(path, src, &mut cx)?;
//!     |                                                 ------- first mutable borrow occurs here
//! 110 |
//! 111 |         script.evaluate(&mut cx)
//!     |                -------- ^^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
//!     |                |
//!     |                first borrow later used by call
//!
//! For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0499`.
//! ```
//! The fix is to explicit root `script`. To do so, we use the `letroot!` macro implemented in
//! this module.
//! ```no_run rust
//! pub fn compile_and_evaluate<S>(
//!     path: &Path,
//!     src: &str,
//!     mut cx: &mut Context<S>,
//! ) -> Option<JsValue<'_, C>> where S: InCompartment<C> + CanAlloc {
//!     letroot!(script = Script::compile(path, src, &mut cx)?; [cx]);
//!
//!     script.evaluate(&mut cx)
//! }
//! ```
//! The declaration of a root allocates space on the stack for a new root. Note that it is just the reference
//! that is copied to the stack, the JS cell is still stored on the heap.
//!
//! Roots have type `Rooted<'a,T>` where `'a` is the lifetime of the root, and T is the
//! type being rooted. Once the local variables are rooted, the code typechecks, because
//! rooting changes the lifetime of the value. The rule is given as follows:
//!
//!  p: T<'a, C>  r: Pin<&'b mut Root<T<'b, C>>
//! --------------------------------------------- 'b : 'a
//!         r.init(p) : T<'b, C>  
//!
//! where `T` is some JS type that contains the lifetime `'a` and is in the compartment `C`.
//! Note that `T<'b, C>` represents *substituting* the lifetime `'b` for the lifetime `'a` recursively on the
//! structure of `T`.
//!
//! Before rooting, the JS value had lifetime `'a`, which is usually the lifetime of the borrow of
//! the `Context` that created or accessed it. After rooting, the JS value has lifetime `'b`, which
//! is the lifetime of the root itself. Since roots are considered reachable by GC, the contents of a root
//! are guaranteed not to be GCâ€™d during its lifetime, so this rule is sound.
//!
//! Note that this use of substitution `T<'b, C>` is being used to extend the lifetime of the JS value
//! since `'b : 'a`.
