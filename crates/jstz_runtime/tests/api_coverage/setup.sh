# Fetch the baseline file and the script with helper functions that are part of the test extension.
# This script must be run from the root of this crate.

# The source baseline file is a JSON file. Importing JSON files in a deno extension doesn't seem to
# be straightforward, so here it is changed to a script file whose only job is to export the baseline
# data as a JSON object.
